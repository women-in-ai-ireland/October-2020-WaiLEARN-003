Chest radiograph showed bilateral, patchy, ill-defined lung infiltrates (Figure 1B). Throat swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR (Corman et al., 2020). He progressively became more dependent on supplemental oxygen (Figure 1A), with worsening lung infiltrates on chest radiograph. His respiratory function reached a nadir on day 5 post illness onset, as evidenced by the oxygen saturation (Figure 1C) and tachycardia (Figure 1D) despite 4L of supplemental oxygen. He was initiated on oral lopinavir-ritonavir on the same day. After the first two positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR findings, subsequent throat swabs from Case 1 were only positive in...</td>\n",

Imaging Notes: Bilateral airspace opacity affecting both lungs, this has progressed markedly from previous chest x-ray (not shown). The patient was admitted but there was no clinical response to IV antibiotics. Bronchoscopy did not identify a cause with cultures and viral testing negative. He was treated with oral corticosteroids with improvement in symptoms and subsequent radiographic resolution.. Discussion: The clinical scenario of progressive peripheral airspace opacity without response to antibiotics is suspicious for cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, although in this case, it is most likely an organizing pneumonia secondary to infection.</td>\n",

There was some opacity just above the right horizontal fissure which may suggest progression of infection into right upper lobe. The right heart border was lost. During her admission at hospital, the opacity spread to right upper lobe and started to develop opacity on left lung field and more prominent air-bronchogram which consistent with wide spread of infection across both lung.

Shortness of breath and cough. The visualized lung fields show hazy opacification with peribronchial and some interstitial prominence in the form of fine reticular interstitial pulmonary pattern. The case showed progressive deterioration as shown from the demonstrated XR sequences. The last one shows more diffuse infiltrates with ET tube insertion in ventilated victim. Diffuse bilateral reticular opacities or septal thickening are present. A crazy paving pattern may therefore be seen when both ground-glass opacies and septal thickening are superimposed on one another.

Although there is no focus of airspace opacification, there is hazy ground glass involving both lungs and a reticular pattern of opacification.  The lungs are of normal volume, there is no collapse and no pleural effusion. Further features in the history were gradual weight loss.  A whole body CT was performed to look for sources of infection and lymphadenopathy. A mid and lower zone diffuse ground glass pattern was seen, with admixed areas of interlobular septal thickening, giving a \"crazy paving\" pattern. Some small cystic spaces were observed too.

The patient presented with a 4-day history of myalgia and febrile sensation. COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Chest X-ray showed increased opacity on the right lower lung area, and C-reactive protein level was slightly elevated. The patient was treated with antiviral agents (lopinavir/ritonavir), and treatment with cDMARDs was discontinued except hydroxychloroquine. Her symptoms and laboratory results gradually improved. Three weeks later, real-time PCR for COVID-19 showed negative conversion, and the patient was discharged without any complications. a No abnormal findings were observed at hospitali...

When the rescue arrived, she regained consciousness and became unrest. At the emergency department, a brief neurological examination revealed a GCS of 12 (E3 M6 V3), without focal sensorimotor deficits. No signs of both tongue biting and incontinence were reported by the familiars. Anosmia and ageusia were referred by several days. Head CT scan was normal (Fig. 1).

He progressively became more dependent on supplemental oxygen (Figure 1A), with worsening lung infiltrates on chest radiograph. His respiratory function reached a nadir on day 5 post illness onset, as evidenced by the oxygen saturation (Figure 1C) and tachycardia (Figure 1D) despite 4L of supplemental oxygen. He was initiated on oral lopinavir-ritonavir on the same day. After the first two positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR findings, subsequent throat swabs from Case 1 were only positive in...

She suffered from hypertension and postencephalitic epilepsy. When she was 76, the patient developed a Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) encephalitis. The initial presentation of the herpetic encephalitis were repetitive oral buccal automatisms and aphasia lasting 6 h associated with the electroencephalographic findings of subcontinuous epileptiform discharges over the left temporal fields, configuring a non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). The status epilepticus was successfully treated with a sequence of antiepileptic drugs.

In the lung segments not affected by the findings just described, there are no widespread alterations of the interstitium. No pleural effusion.  The case presented confirms the limited sensitivity of the X-ray examination and the usefulness of CT in case of discrepancy with clinical data.

Imaging Notes: Bilateral air space patchy consolidations, mainly distributed in the right lung and left lower lung zone.. No pleural effusion.. No pneumothorax.. Discussion: Cardiac size appears normal.This is a young male patient came with a typical history of COVID-19: fever and dry cough.. The chest x-ray is typical for the disease in terms of patchy consolidations and lack pf pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy. The PCR test came positive, and there was no need to go for a chest CT scan.

Imaging Notes: Bilateral peripheral patchy air space opacitites, more prominent in the left lower lobe, associated with broncovascular thickening.. Discussion: The X-ray film shows typical features of advanced COVID-19 disease, as seen in many cases from the literature. A first sample was taken and tested negative for coronavirus disease. However, a family member living in the same house had a positive test at the same time.. After hospitlization, a second sample was taken and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Imaging Notes: Predominantly mid to lower zone airspace opacity. No large pleural effusion.. Discussion: The chest x-ray features of legionella pneumonia are non-specific but include a mid-to-lower zone predominance of patchy consolidation and the condition is sometimes associated with pleural effusions (~ 30%). . Radiographic deterioration does not correlate well with clinical condition.

Imaging Notes: Areas of consolidation remain in the middle lobe, with atelectasic component.. Diffuse low-density, poorly defined opacities persist in the lower right lobe, especially on the lateral projection, with no sign of significant regression over prior exams.. Ill-definition of the bronchovascular bundles in the lower left lung.. Subpleural opacities remain unaltered near the pulmonary apices, which may be related to previous radiotherapy procedure.. Discussion: Patient provides a history of regular mineral oil ingestion, and along with areas of fat density consolidation and no improvement with long-term antibiotics suggest the...

Increasing shortness of breath despite oral antibiotics. . Imaging Notes: Bilateral airspace opacity affecting both lungs, this has progressed markedly from previous chest x-ray (not shown). The patient was admitted but there was no clinical response to IV antibiotics. Bronchoscopy did not identify a cause with cultures and viral testing negative. He was treated with oral corticosteroids with improvement in symptoms and subsequent radiographic resolution.. Discussion: The clinical scenario of progressive peripheral airspace opacity without response to antibiotics is suspicious for cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, although in this case, it is most likely an organizing pneumonia secondary to infection.

Imaging Notes: There are bibasilar infiltrates greater on left. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggest a small left pleural effusion.. Discussion: The patient had a long history of constipation and ingested mineral oil for its known laxative effect.  He presented to the emergency room with chronic cough and shortness of breath for 6 months. Unaware, he may have aspirated the mineral oil at some time during his self treatment..

Post bone marrow transplant for mantle cell lymphoma. Previous cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.. Imaging Notes: Bilateral ill-defined nodular opacities throughout both lungs with more confluent consolidation in the left upper lobe. Several of the nodules have apparent central lucency which is suspicious for cavitation. The lung volumes are reduced. There is no pleural fluid and the cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.. COP may explain the reduced lung volumes and more peripheral confluent areas of consolidation, particularly in the left upper lobe. The possibility of cavitating nodules is however not easily explained and in the immunocompromised patient consideration to invasive aspergillosis or other atypical infections should be given...

Imaging Notes: PA film demonstrates opacification within the left mid to upper zones which partially obscures the left heart border consistent with left upper lobe consolidation, particularly involving the lingular segments. There is hazy opacity in the right lower zone medially and the right heart border is not visualized.  This could be misinterpreted as an additional right middle lobe consolidation, however this is in fact due to a pectus excavatum deformity, which is suggested by the orientation of the ribs and is confirmed on the lateral film. . Discussion: This case demonstrates the typical appearance of pectus excavatum on frontal chest radiographs and how one might be tempted to incorrectly report right middle lobe pathology especially in the se...

Diffuse airspace opacities in both lungs, less consolidative in comparison to part A. Multiple bilateral air bronchograms are highlighted (arrows). The left lung is asymmetrically slightly more consolidated compared to the right. An endotracheal tube is shown with its tip above the level of the clavicular heads in the cervical trachea (white arrow). There is marked gastric distension with air (asterisk). The large opaque circular artifact on the right chest represents the grommet of the sealed body bag, and the small opaque circular artifacts represent buttons on clothing. Autopsy revealed acute bronchopneumonia.

Unresponsive to antibiotic treatment. Asthmatic, smoker. PA upright: Basal-predominant patchy alveolar opacities superimposed on reticular opacities. The patient had been on empiric antibiotic treatment prescribed at the health maintenance clinic for a presumptive diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia. Complete blood count on hospital admission was remarkable for eosinophilia (10,000/µL, with the normal range being 0-400/µL). The patient was treated with ceftriaxone, clarithromycin, and prednisone, with a complete resolution of symptoms within a single day.

Diffuse, bilateral, inhomogeneous airspace opacities, which do not show a perihilar predominance. Resultant aerobronchograms. Considering the known chronic heart disease, and multiple other comorbidities, as well as the symptoms heart failure and resultant pulmonary edema could be on the list of differentials. However the absence of a perihilar predominance and the patchy distribution of airspace opacities also raises the possibility of diffuse pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection.

His medical history was irrelevant and he had no further complaints. His first chest radiograph (not shown) showed infiltrates in the left lung. Despite antibiotic treatment, a control chest radiograph showed persistent infiltration in the left lower lobe. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further work-up. Physical examination and laboratory tests on admission were normal. Subsequent bronchoscopic examinations, sputum culture and cytology yielded no abnormalities. A CT scan of the chest was performed. Based on radiological findings, malignancy of the left lower lobe was suspected.
